                    My work focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning to complex, real-world data problems.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in machine learning, deep learning,
                and applied data-driven systems. My work focuses on building end-to-end solutions that combine
                solid theoretical foundations with practical engineering considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working on problems that require understanding complex data, designing robust models,
                and translating technical ideas into clear, maintainable implementations. My academic and
                project experience spans research-oriented work as well as applied problem solving.

                <h3>Sleep Stage Analysis with Deep Learning & XAI</h3>
                <p>
                    Built a deep learning based system for sleep stage classification using EEG/PSG data.
                    Integrated CNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based models with explainability techniques
                    such as SHAP and LIME to improve interpretability and clinical relevance.

                <h3>Cotton Plant Leaf Disease Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed and trained convolutional neural networks to detect and classify diseases
                    in cotton plant leaves. Focused on dataset preprocessing, augmentation, and model
                    evaluation for real-world deployment scenarios.

            <p>
                Football is something I actively make time for. I play regularly and enjoy both the competitive
                aspect of the game and the discipline that comes with being part of a team. It has strongly
                influenced how I think about collaboration, adaptability, and consistency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Music is a constant part of my day. I spend a lot of time discovering new artists and genres,
                and I am always curating playlists based on mood and activity. Whether I am coding, traveling,
                or training, music is almost always playing in the background.
            </p>

            <p>
                I train at the gym consistently and treat fitness as a long-term discipline rather than a
                short-term goal. The mindset of incremental improvement and routine carries over directly
                into how I approach learning and technical projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also an active gamer across PC and mobile platforms, including Valorant, FIFA, Rocket
                League, Destiny 2, and Clash Royale. In Clash Royale, I consistently rank within the top 5%
                of players globally, reflecting a strong focus on strategy, optimization, and long-term
                progression.
